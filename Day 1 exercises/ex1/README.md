# Instructions

1. Fix the code so it prints out the alphabet A-Z in the console.

2. Cannot:
	- Have **any** global variables at all
	- Delete or combine any function declarations
	- Create any new functions (except IIFEs -- hint!)
	- Rearrange the order of declarations

3. Can/must:
	- Declare extra variables (as long as they're not global)
	- Modify (in-place) function declaration/initialization
	- Add/remove statements/expressions (IIFEs, return, params, etc)
	- Make the fewest changes possible
